        1. Figure out how Re-Login will work after key has expired
            Idea:
                Have the service notify the Main Screen. Have the Main Screen
            attempt to re-login and acquire the key. If it succeeds, it's all good.
            If there is a problem (the credentials are no longer valid), log the user out
            and prompt them to log in

            How-to:
                Have an InterCallback interface. Have loginCallback, logoutCallback, gpsManagerCallback,
            ListManagerCallback, ListResponseCallback extend the InterCallback interface.

            MainScreen: Implements both LogCallbacks. If logout is called, it tries to re-login.
                        If Login is called with an error code, it calls logOut()

                        Implements ListResponseHandler to handle the incoming list updates

            LoginScreen: Implements LoginCallback and allows the user into the MainScreen if
                         Login is called with no error code

            Service: Implements the GpsManagerCallback to handle permission problems. If one exists
                     it broadcasts an error signal and MainScreen handles it


           Note: I could replace all callbacks with Broadcasts. It would increase additional code
           requirements by too much. Scratch that
        2. Create a Callback interface hierarchy (for better organizing)
        3. Debug Web Service (can't do that yet)
        4. Finish the rest of the features (settings, credits etc)



        Do something about shifts (must not update their shift if it has not been finished)


        -> move this one up the list __
                                       |
                                       v
        Preferences are working. Need to restart service upon interval change (URL still working)


        Add gps and internet checkers (on GpsSender and on NewPharmacy)

        Find some time to sort this shit out!
