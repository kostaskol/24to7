    By priority:
        1. Figure out how Re-Login will work after key has expired
            Idea:
                Have the service notify the Main Screen. Have the Main Screen
            attempt to re-login and acquire the key. If it succeeds, it's all good.
            If there is a problem (the credentials are no longer valid), log the user out
            and prompt them to log in

            How-to:
                Have an InterCallback interface. Have loginCallback, logoutCallback, gpsManagerCallback,
            ListManagerCallback, ListResponseCallback extend the InterCallback interface.

            MainScreen: Implements both LogCallbacks. If logout is called, it tries to re-login.
                        If Login is called with an error code, it calls logOut()

                        Implements ListResponseHandler to handle the incoming list updates

            LoginScreen: Implements LoginCallback and allows the user into the MainScreen if
                         Login is called with no error code

            Service: Implements the GpsManagerCallback to handle permission problems. If one exists
                     it broadcasts an error signal and MainScreen handles it


           Note: I could replace all callbacks with Broadcasts. It would increase additional code
           requirements by too much. Scratch that
        2. Create a Callback interface hierarchy (for better organizing)
        3. Debug Web Service (can't do that yet)
        4. Finish the rest of the features (settings, credits etc)
